## Overview

This is a responsive news homepage built with React and Vite. The project recreates a modern editorial layout featuring a hero section, sidebar news panel, and a list of trending articles. It focuses on responsive design, component architecture, and clean UI implementation.

### The challenge

The main goal of this project was to recreate a pixel-accurate news homepage design while ensuring:

- Responsive layout across mobile and desktop
- A working mobile navigation drawer
- Clean component separation
- Proper image importing with Vite
- CSS Grid layout for desktop structure

## My process

### Built with

- React
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- CSS Grid & Flexbox
- Responsive mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Through this project, I strengthened my understanding of:

- Structuring React apps into reusable components
- Managing UI state for mobile navigation
- Using CSS Grid for complex responsive layouts
- Importing static assets correctly in react
- Creating responsive image layouts with the `<picture>` element

I also learned how small spacing and typography adjustments greatly improve UI polish.

### Continued development

In future iterations, I would like to:

- Add animations for smoother UI transitions
- Improve accessibility (ARIA roles, keyboard navigation)
- Introduce routing for multi-page navigation
- Optimize performance and image loading
- Add dark mode support

### Useful resources

- React documentation — https://react.dev
- CSS Grid guide — https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/

These resources helped clarify layout techniques and React best practices.

### AI Collaboration

AI tools were used to:

- Debug layout and grid issues

The AI acted as a coding assistant, helping speed up problem-solving and improving code organization while I focused on implementation and learning.
